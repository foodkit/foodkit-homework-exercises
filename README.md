## Interview tasks

This repo contains the microsite detailing interview tasks for Foodkit engineering candidates.

It uses [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) and a [gem](https://github.com/edgecase/middleman-gh-pages) to deploy a statically generated site to Github pages (see [here](https://foodkit.github.io/interview-tasks/)).
